# Aarni Junkkala
- I am a teacher at Salo region vocational college.
- I create code for my own fun and share them here.
- Some of my projects are in Finnish, like my Finnish language code collection.
- I like to write in Python. I am trying to expand my skills more around other languages.
- I know how to program in C# and I hate javascript.
